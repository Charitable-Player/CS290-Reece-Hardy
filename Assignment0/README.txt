5 websites with aspects that you either like or dislike (such as good or poor layout, presentation of or overload of  
information, easy or hard to navigate, loads quickly or slowly considering the data on the page, fun or frustrating, 
flashy or boring, cute or dreadful, great or poor interactivity, whatever else you might think of!),

1. I dislike the layout of our webrunner page, it comes across as crude and overly simple
2. https://puginarug.com/ Paying my respects to the puginarug, this website is perfect.
3. https://www.toyota.com/ Strikes a good balance between delivering information while not overloading the reader with information
4. https://onewheel.com/ Does a great job providing many images and video of the product in use and its features.
5. https://amazon.com/ Does very well with compartmentalization and organization. Hundreds of thousands of products all organized and tagged. Does well with recommending related products.
